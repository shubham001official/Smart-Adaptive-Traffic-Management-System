# Smart Adaptive Traffic Management System using YOLO v8 and CCTV

## Introduction

The Smart Adaptive Traffic Management System is an intelligent traffic monitoring and control solution that leverages the power of YOLO v8 (You Only Look Once version 8) object detection algorithm along with CCTV cameras for real-time traffic analysis. The system aims to enhance traffic flow, improve road safety, and reduce congestion by dynamically adjusting traffic signal timings based on the detected traffic conditions.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: YOLO v8 is used to perform real-time object detection, enabling the system to identify various types of vehicles (e.g., cars, bikes, trucks) and pedestrians accurately.

- **Adaptive Traffic Signal Control**: The system optimizes traffic signal timings in response to real-time traffic density and patterns, ensuring efficient traffic management.

- **Web-based User Interface**: The system offers a user-friendly web-based interface, empowering users to remotely monitor traffic conditions, configure system settings, and visualize traffic data.

- **Data Logging and Visualization**: Comprehensive data logging allows the system to record vital traffic data, such as vehicle counts, traffic density, and signal timings, presented through intuitive graphs and charts for in-depth analysis.

## How it Works

1. **Data Acquisition**: Strategically positioned CCTV cameras capture live video feed at key intersections, providing essential traffic data for analysis.

2. **Object Detection**: Utilizing YOLO v8, the system processes the video frames in real-time, accurately identifying and localizing vehicles and pedestrians.

3. **Traffic Analysis**: Leveraging the data from YOLO v8, the system assesses traffic density, vehicle counts, and pedestrian movement to derive valuable insights.

4. **Traffic Signal Control**: Based on the real-time traffic analysis, the system dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings to optimize traffic flow efficiently.

5. **Web Interface**: Users can easily access the web-based interface to monitor live traffic conditions, visualize data, and configure system settings effortlessly.

6. **Data Logging and Visualization**: The system logs essential traffic data, which can be visualized through graphs and charts for deeper analysis and decision-making.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the required hardware, such as CCTV cameras, and dependencies, like a GPU for model inference.

2. **Installation**: Follow step-by-step instructions for setting up the system, including installing necessary libraries and dependencies.

3. **Configuration**: Customize the system to suit specific traffic intersections and camera placements.

4. **Web Interface Setup**: Learn how to access and utilize the web-based monitoring and configuration interface.

## Usage

1. **Start the System**: Initiate the traffic management system, start the video feed, and enable real-time traffic analysis.

2. **Monitoring Traffic**: Access the web interface to observe live traffic conditions and visualize traffic data.

3. **Adapt Signal Timings**: Enable adaptive traffic signal control and witness its positive impact on traffic flow.

4. **Adjusting Settings**: Modify system settings and thresholds to accommodate various traffic scenarios.
