# Smart Adaptive Traffic Management System using YOLO v8 and CCTV

## Introduction

The Smart Adaptive Traffic Management System is an intelligent traffic monitoring and control system that utilizes YOLO v8 (You Only Look Once version 8) object detection algorithm in conjunction with CCTV cameras to perform real-time traffic analysis. The system aims to improve traffic flow, enhance safety, and reduce congestion by dynamically adjusting traffic signal timings based on the detected traffic conditions.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLO v8 to identify various types of vehicles (e.g., cars, bikes, trucks) and pedestrians.
- Adaptive traffic signal control to optimize signal timings based on real-time traffic density and patterns.
- Web-based user interface for monitoring and configuring the system remotely.
- Data logging and visualization for traffic analysis and performance evaluation.

## How it Works

1. **Data Acquisition**: CCTV cameras are strategically placed at key intersections to capture live video feed of the traffic.

2. **Object Detection**: The YOLO v8 model is used to process the video frames in real-time, identifying and localizing vehicles and pedestrians.

3. **Traffic Analysis**: The system analyzes the data from YOLO v8 to determine traffic density, vehicle counts, and pedestrian movement.

4. **Traffic Signal Control**: Based on the traffic analysis, the system dynamically adjusts the traffic signal timings to optimize traffic flow.

5. **Web Interface**: The system provides a user-friendly web-based interface for users to monitor the traffic conditions, adjust settings, and visualize traffic data.

6. **Data Logging and Visualization**: The system logs all the traffic data, including vehicle counts, traffic density, and signal timings. This data can be visualized through graphs and charts for further analysis.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**: Mention any hardware requirements and dependencies for the project (e.g., CCTV cameras, GPU for model inference).

2. **Installation**: Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up the system, installing required libraries, and dependencies.

3. **Configuration**: Explain how to configure the system for specific traffic intersections and camera placements.

4. **Web Interface Setup**: Detail the steps to access and use the web-based monitoring and configuration interface.

## Usage

1. **Start the System**: Describe how to initiate the traffic management system, start the video feed, and enable real-time traffic analysis.

2. **Monitoring Traffic**: Explain how to access the web interface for monitoring live traffic conditions and visualizing traffic data.

3. **Adapt Signal Timings**: Instruct users on how to enable adaptive traffic signal control and its impact on traffic flow.

4. **Adjusting Settings**: Provide instructions on how to modify system settings and thresholds based on specific traffic scenarios.
